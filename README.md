criteria to meet on this project:


when I click the button, the window gives me a series of prompts for password criteria. I select which criteria to include in the password and the length of the password more than 8 and no more than 128 characters. The character type options include lowecase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. When I've answer each prompt, my input should be validated. Then a password is generated to match the criteria I provided and is displayed in the text box on the screen
